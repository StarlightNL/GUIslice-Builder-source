In this fork I will try to add the following functions:
- JSON import and export functionality to create a GUI with only text.
    The JSON will support "modules" that are pre made elements grouped together for fast repetitive parts of a gui.
- Control via serial port.
    This will be like the nextion displays. A gui running on a sepperate controller

## Brief Overview
The GUIslice Builder is a standalone desktop application that is more than a layout tool for your UI. It's designed as 
No Code GUI Generator for User Interfaces that make use of GUIslice API. 

The cross-platform utility includes a WYSIWYG graphical editor that enables drag & drop placement of UI elements. Once a GUI has been laid out, the Builder can then generate a fully functional GUIslice Graphical UI complete with plug-in points for your custom application. 

The GUIslice API framework code can handle hardware like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 and more. It supports Graphic libraries like 
Adafruit's GFX, M5Stack, TFT_eSPI and LINUX with a wide variety of TFT Display Drivers and combinations of Touch support chips.

The generated output code (*.c, *.ino, *_GSLC.h) includes all of the necessary defines, UI storage elements and initialization 
in addition to the placement of the UI elements. This will greatly improve the ease in creating a new Graphical Application.

## Release History

### Enhancements for 0.16.0

With this release the Builder becomes a true WYSIWYG editor for most platforms. The Builder now reads and parses 
your actual Platform Font header and c files and renders them inside the Builder. This native font support will now 
be able to give you accurate sizing and positioning information for supported fonts. Plus your text will be now 
displayed exactly as it will appear on your target TFT display. 

The Native Font support includes, Adafruit's Builtin GLCD fonts, and Adafruit's GFX compatable fonts, and 
Teensy ILI9341_t3 fonts. This Native Font support includes the ability to add your own fonts to the Builder 
simply by dropping them into the proper folders. You may also tell the Builder to simulate fonts it doesn't directly support. 

See the User Guide for more information about font handling and how to add your custom fonts.

GUIslice API 0.16.0 has upgraded the Keypad support. This is a breaking change for the API so the Builder 
will now require running with GUIslice API 0.16.0 and higher. For further information on keypads 
refer to the wiki page [Custom KeyPads](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/GUIslice/wiki/Custom-KeyPads)

The Builder has added support for ctrl-Z for Undo and ctrl-Y for Redo.

### Enhancements 0.16.b006
